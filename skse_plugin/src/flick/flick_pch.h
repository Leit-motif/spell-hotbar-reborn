// Precompiled prelude for every translation unit in the sh2_flick object library.
//
// These TUs do NOT use the plugin's PCH. The split is the boundary between the side that draws --
// these files, through FUCK:: -- and the side that owns the state, reached through headers that
// carry no drawing (`rendering/ui_bridge.h`, `flick/flick_watch.h`, `flick/flick_windows.h`).
//
// Two rules follow, and both are enforced mechanically rather than by memory:
//
//   1. Inside a FLICK `Draw()`, only `FUCK::` calls. SH2 links its own ImGui with its own GImGui,
//      which is uninitialised on FLICK's render path; one `ImGui::TextEx` there crashes the
//      game. The real imgui.h is included here for its types, so a stray `ImGui::` call would
//      compile; CMake greps src/ for one and fails the configure.
//   2. No FLICK TU includes `rendering/render_manager.h`; it `#error`s when SH2_FLICK_TU is
//      defined. The texture registry answers through ui_bridge.h.
//
// Order is load-bearing: CommonLib's REX/W32/BASE.h hard-errors if <Windows.h> was included ahead
// of it ("Please move any Windows API includes after CommonLib"), so SKSE comes first.
