// SH2's connection to FLICK (`FUCK.dll`) and the in-menu dock. The bind menu, the editors and
// the bar drag are FLICK windows too; they live in flick_windows.h. The watch half exists because
// `RE::UI` cannot see a FLICK window at all, so without it SH2 has no way to know that Fitting
// Room's editor is open over the Inventory menu: it paints its bar across that editor and
// swallows the letter C out of its search box.
//
// Deliberately free of ImGui types. The SMF side of the plugin draws through SMF's `ImGuiMCP`
// vocabulary, which declares its own `ImVec2`; FLICK's header includes the real `imgui.h`, which
// declares another. The two cannot share a translation unit, so the FLICK side compiles as its
// own CMake target (sh2_flick, see flick_pch.h) and hands back plain types.

    // The dock is a FLICK window because that is the only way a Spell Hotbar 2 surface can take
    // the mouse over a vanilla menu: SMF sets ImGuiConfigFlags_NoMouse there, FLICK pumps its
    // own. Measured: a FLICK-hosted button over the Magic menu reported
    // IsItemHovered() and six clicks, with the menu still rendering underneath.
    //
    // This translation unit cannot see SH2's bars, forms or textures (it compiles apart, without
    // the PCH -- see CMakeLists), so the SMF side builds a display list in plain types each frame
    // and hands it over. Coordinates are pixels relative to the dock's content origin. Textures
    // are named by file: FLICK only draws images it loaded itself (its handle is opaque, and
    // handing it a texture loaded elsewhere draws nothing, measured), and its loader reads PNG,
    // not DDS, so the FLICK side loads each atlas's PNG (flick_images.h). Colours are ImGui's
    // packed ABGR (IM_COL32).
