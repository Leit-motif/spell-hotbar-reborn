// Spell Hotbar 2's windows as FLICK guests. One tabbed window carries Spellbind and, on an
// Advanced tab, the spell and potion editors; the bar-position editor is its own chromeless
// preview. This header is free of ImGui types on purpose -- the rest of the plugin
// (render_manager.cpp, input.cpp, plugin.cpp) includes it to open and close windows and to ask
// whether one is up; the content is drawn on the FLICK side, in flick/ui/, and never leaks a
// type across.
//
// `Window` names a SURFACE the caller wants on screen, not a FUCK::IWindow: the first three are
// tabs of the one window, and opening one selects its tab. Each surface's state lives in its own
// model in flick/ui/; this module is the single place that turns those into IWindows. The host
// owns window position and chrome; SH2 owns the content.
